## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important:**
- These are test credentials for development only
- Use strong, unique passwords in production
- Implement proper password policies
- Enable two-factor authentication for admin users
- Regularly rotate credentials
- Monitor user access logs

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**

1. **Login fails with "Invalid credentials":**
   - Ensure Supabase Auth user was created
   - Verify email spelling matches exactly
   - Check password meets requirements

2. **User has access but wrong role:**
   - Verify database user role matches intended permissions
   - Check organization assignment

3. **Pages redirect to login:**
   - Ensure JWT tokens are being set correctly
   - Check authentication middleware

### **Database Verification Commands:**

```sql
-- Check all users
SELECT email, role, full_name FROM users ORDER BY role;

-- Check organization assignment
SELECT u.email, u.role, o.name as organization
FROM users u
JOIN organizations o ON u.organization_id = o.id;
```
